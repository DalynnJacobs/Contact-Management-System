# Python Contact-Management-System
A command-line tool for managing contacts, built with Python. It features data persistence, error checking, and a user-friendly menu.

## Features

* **Add Contacts:** Easily add new contacts with their name, email, and phone number.
* **Error Checking:** The system validates that phone numbers are 10 digits long and that emails contain a valid format.
* **Data Persistence:** Your contacts are automatically saved to `contacts.json` and loaded each time you run the program, so you won't lose any data.
* **Search Functionality:** Quickly find a contact by searching for their full name.

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have a recent version of Python installed on your system.

### Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Python-Contact-Management-System.git](https://github.com/your-username/Python-Contact-Management-System.git)
    cd Python-Contact-Management-System
    ```
    (Note: You'll need to replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.)

2.  **Run the script from your terminal:**
    ```bash
    python contact_management_system.py
    ```

3.  Follow the on-screen menu to start adding, displaying, or finding contacts.

## Future Improvements

* Add an option to **edit or delete** existing contacts.
* Implement a more **robust search** that can find contacts by email or phone number.
* Allow for saving additional contact details, such as address or company.
